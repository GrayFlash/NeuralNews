She apprised the meeting that both Rapid Antigen Tests and RT-PCR testing had been boosted and home isolation was being encouraged. Citing data, she said a total of 948 healthcare workers in the state had tested positive so far, with two deaths and one seriously ill. Around 700 had recovered while 245 were still in isolation, she said, adding that these healthcare workers needed to be encouraged through public appreciation of their good work.\", 'PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar said whether or not a formal resolution had been passed by villages, the role of miscreants was definitely evident and a close watch should be kept on such elements. He underscored the coincidence between the deadly campaign and the AAP decision to distribute oximeters, saying this clearly indicated AAP role in the false propaganda.', 'Panchayats should be encouraged to propagate early testing and home quarantine, Jakhar said. The Punjab Congress president also lauded the excellent work done by the concerned departments and teams at hospitals in battling the pandemic and called for recognising the contribution of doctors and other health staff.', \"In a brief presentation, Health Secretary Hussan Lal said the vicious campaign to discredit the government's efforts had impacted testing, which had gone down. With patients reporting late in tertiary care institutions, the number of deaths there had gone up, he said. The Secretary said the department was being liberal on home isolation to mitigate the fear of the patients and encourage people to get themselves tested.\", 'Speaker Rana KP Singh, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and MLAs Nazar Singh Mansahia, Kulbir Singh Zira, Hardial Singh Kamboj, Dalvir Singh Goldy, Surjit Singh Dhiman, Rana Gurjit Singh, Angad Saini and Fateh Singh Bajwa also participated, along with several senior officials.', "},"Image_Url":{"0":"https:\/\/akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com\/indiatoday\/images\/story\/202009\/TMU_Moradabad_0-170x96.png?UbNAwfNHxJX_hLhDBcXnG1xgX.ZAPsS9","1":"https:\/\/akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com\/indiatoday\/images\/story\/202009\/Portland_protests__AP_-170x96.jpeg?UZbyPiyCD5gd.pOx5mzMdGccHP3muoeN","2":"https:\/\/akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com\/indiatoday\/images\/story\/202009\/Chandrababu_Naidu_car_accident-170x96.png?jwEoboI4eenuaKMzcBzwmRgMXtW_kSyt","3":"https:\/\/akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com\/indiatoday\/images\/story\/202009\/Anubhav_Mohanty-170x96.png?AQPzwfMu24pRkOH6Tgawa16aHVO3pO2i","4":"https:\/\/akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com\/indiatoday\/images\/story\/202009\/Kaavan__AP_-170x96.jpeg?61kkyPXkZw_lNwhwJUAa.zu08bXAWD8k","5":"https:\/\/akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com\/indiatoday\/images\/story\/202009\/Late_Mr_Akhilesh_Kumar_and_Wif-170x96.jpeg?APcgwYFjRRK6LIfbQrCEir6fe5Tgua.P","6":"https:\/\/akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com\/indiatoday\/images\/story\/202009\/drugs-story-170x96.jpeg?Oca1xsIaxrq7BAQewxeIh_Y_S7_C_NSZ","7":"https:\/\/akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com\/indiatoday\/images\/story\/202009\/Screen_Shot_2020-09-06_at_12.0-170x96.png?L1uWSlHvjLverVeqLh7TZvTIyii73akU","8":"https:\/\/akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com\/indiatoday\/images\/story\/202009\/AP20249653261885-170x96.jpeg?nJxxalTfaAtkUv.M5ISTFee__jkvbFNd","9":"https:\/\/akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com\/indiatoday\/images\/story\/202009\/GettyImages-1228234731-170x96.jpeg?OIv6tYcyNIVZmnuES5TKyuguW.TSiW61","10":"https:\/\/akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com\/indiatoday\/images\/story\/202009\/iit-k_0-170x96.jpeg?o425aN1XySU0KcbrGA0aVv_IMqmHH._r","11":"https:\/\/akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com\/indiatoday\/images\/story\/202009\/Amarinder_Singh__PTI__0-170x96.jpeg?fwxZxqLUluILxJdMibZ3Qn4JojfIBbSq"},"label":{"0":79.8852854915,"1":69.5748419138,"2":86.1801817227,"3":78.7100558399,"4":83.9981877079,"5":89.9409190895,"6":99.9333269402,"7":99.8168676939,"8":79.6259744184,"9":96.0968557528,"10":89.8612608455,"11":37.0025039788},"Summary":{"0":" \",","1":" ', 'Oregon State Police troopers assisted local police at the protest.
